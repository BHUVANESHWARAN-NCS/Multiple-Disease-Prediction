📌 Multiple Disease Prediction System
🛠 Overview
The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a Streamlit-based web application that uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of three diseases:
✅ Kidney Disease 💧
✅ Liver Disease 🍂
✅ Parkinson's Disease 🧠

This application provides an easy-to-use interface where users can enter their health parameters and receive predictions based on trained AI models.

🔧 Features
User-friendly Web App: Built using Streamlit for an interactive UI.
Multiple Disease Predictions: Predicts Kidney, Liver, and Parkinson’s diseases.
Machine Learning Integration: Uses pre-trained models (pickle format).
Data Input Forms: Users can input health data via a dynamic form.
Health Recommendations: Provides basic health advice based on predictions.

📊 How It Works
1️⃣ Launch the App using streamlit run MDP.py.
2️⃣ Select a Disease from the sidebar menu.
3️⃣ Enter Health Parameters (Age, Blood Pressure, Proteins, etc.).
4️⃣ Click Predict to get results.
5️⃣ Receive Health Advice based on AI predictions.

🚀 Future Improvements
Add more disease models for better health analytics.
Improve UI & UX with better design elements.
Integrate real-time health monitoring features.
